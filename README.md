This is my Portfolio. My goal was to have a lot of fun doing it... I did.

## Home Page (Windows 11)
For the home page, I've made a copy of Windows 11. On the main screen there's 3 elements, the link to the "About Me" page, the link to the "My Projects" page and a button to the file explorer.

To access everything that's on the main screen, you need to double-click.

If you open the File Explorer, you can navigate from tab to tab. _hint: try going to the audio tab._

If you look at the bottom of your screen, you'll find a taskbar. On it, you can find the start menu that you can toggle.

In the start menu, I let you discover what makes what. Some buttons will take you to some of my account.

I won't tell you everything there is, you'll need to experiment by yourself to know what is doing what.

Because my main page is Windows, for my other pages, I've choose to make game or program.

## My Projects (Muse Dash) [To the page](./PAGES/projects/)
To show my projects. I've made something mostly inspired by the selection menu of the rhythm game "Muse Dash".

You can navigate from project to project using the 2 arrows buttons. You can also let the slider slide automatically. For each project, at the bottom of the screen, there's some links and even an information button if you ever wanna more about a project.

## About Me (Visual Novel) [To the page](./PAGES/aboutMe/)
For a page like this one that I knew from the beginning that there would be a lot of text I was thinking on how to put a lot of text in a program or a game. Then I thought of "Higurashi" a Sound Novel I really like. So I've made a Visual Novel.

The backgrounds images are from me, except the one use on the title screen that is from Chat GPT.
